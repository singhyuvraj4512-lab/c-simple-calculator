# C Simple Calculator

A menu-driven console calculator written in C that performs common arithmetic operations, including advanced operations like modulus and power. The program includes basic error handling for invalid input and division/modulus by zero.

## Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Modulus operation (integer-based)
* Power calculation using math library
* Menu-driven interface with continuous execution
* Error handling for invalid input and division/modulus by zero

## Technologies Used

* C Programming Language
* Standard C Libraries (`stdio.h`, `math.h`)

## How to Run

1. Compile the program:

   ```
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator -lm
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```
   ./calculator
   ```

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

* Functions in C
* Switch-case control structure
* Loops and user input handling
* Basic error handling
* Use of the math library
